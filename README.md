# SSP
SSP, may acronym of 'Series Seanrio Punishment' or 'Seanrio Style Punishment'. It's a little game to tell why story consistency is important...

Motive:
I am a anime fan. Just months ago, I watch Kantai Collection's anime...
It was poor expierment because plot's style is not unity, so there were many weird thing in that anime.
After watched, I found a review said it's because writers' style in anime are totally different.
So I just think...How can I show the problem?
And this small program born...^^

How is works:
-------------------------------
(s1+s2+s3)-(((s1-s3))*3)+diretor*0.2

Firstily, add three people's ability:
(s1+s2+s3)
s1 means the best seanrio writer and s3 means the worst seanrio writer:
s1-s3
Then multiplied by 3 because adverse effects:
((s1-s3)*3)
Finally, good diretor may can help:
diretor*0.2

What I want to try in further:
-------------------------------
Just new in programming, so there many thing not familiar...
1. s1,s2,s3 can only rank best,so-so,and worst. I want to let program self-check which is best and worst though I don't type by ranking, however.
2. Input. Someday I hope I can input directory instead of edit by editor.
3. For cirle may interesting, but I just learning this now, so...
